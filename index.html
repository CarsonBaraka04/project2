    <h3 style="color: blue;font-style: italic;text-align: center;text-decoration: underline;">Chapter One</h3>
    <p>The animal kingdom is full of surprises. Did you know that 
        a group of owls is called a parliament? Or that ostriches 
        can run faster than humans, reaching speeds of up to 
        70 kilometers per hour? Even the tiny tardigrade, also known
         as the water bear, is an amazing creature. It can survive in
          extreme environments, including boiling temperatures, 
          freezing cold, and even the vacuum of space!</p>

<h3 style="font-style: italic;color: red;text-decoration: underline;text-align: right;">Chapter Two</h3>
<p>Our planet Earth is also full of fascinating facts.
     The population of the Earth is constantly changing,
      but it's estimated that there are over 8 billion 
      people living here right now! That's a lot of people!
       And even though Earth seems like a big place, the deepest
        part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench, is deeper than Mount
         Everest is tall!</p>
